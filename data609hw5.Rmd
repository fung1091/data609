1) Consider a model for the long-term dining behavior of the students at College USA. It is found that 25% of the students who eat at the college's Grease Dining Hall return to eat there again, wheras those who eat at Sweet Dining Hall have a 93% return rate. These are the only two dining halls available on campus, and assume that all students eat at one of these halls. Formulate a model to solve for the long-term percentage of students eating at each hall.

Based on the parameters of the problem 

25% return rate at Grease, 75% at Sweet
93% return rate at Sweet, 7% at Grease

```{r}
model <- function(Snaught, Gnaught)
{
  sweet <- Snaught
  grease <- Gnaught

  df <- data.frame(i=c(0), Sweet=c(sweet), Grease=c(grease))
  for(i in 1:100)
  {
    sweet1 <- 0.25 * grease + 0.07 * sweet
    grease1 <- 0.75 * grease + 0.93 * sweet
    sweet <- sweet1
    grease <- grease1
    df <- rbind(df, cbind(i=c(i), Sweet=sweet, Grease=grease))
  }
  return(df)
}

Snaught <- 50
Gnaught <- 50
df5050 <- model(Snaught, Gnaught)
knitr::kable(head(df5050,20))

```

Steady state is reached after 10 iterations.

1) Consider a stereo with CD player, FM-AM radio tuner, speakers (dual), and power amplifier (PA) componenets, as displayed with the reliabilities shown in Figure 6.11. Determine the system's reliability. What assumptions are required in your model?

![Figure 6.11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fung1091/data609/master/232.png)



```{r}
#Speakers are in parallel
speakers <- 0.99 + 0.99 - (0.99*0.99)
speakers

#radio and CD in parallel
radiocd <- 0.98 + 0.97 - (0.98*0.97)
radiocd

#PA is solo
PA <- 0.95

reliability <- PA * radiocd * speakers
reliability
```

Use the basic linear model y = ax+b to fit the folowing data sets. Provide the model, provide the values of SSE, SSR, and $R^2$, and provide a residual plot.

1) For table 2.7, predict weight as function of height

![Table 2.7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fung1091/data609/master/2_7.png)

```{r, tidy=TRUE}
height <- c(60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80)
weight <- c(132,136,141,145,150,155,160,165,170,175,180,185,190,195,201,206,212,218,223,229,234)
df <- data.frame(height, weight)

m <- nrow(df)

a <- (m * sum(df$height * df$weight) - sum(df$height) * sum(df$weight)) / 
  (m * sum(df$height^2) - sum(df$height)^2)

b <- (sum(df$height^2) * sum(df$weight) - sum(df$height * df$weight) * sum(df$height)) / 
  (m * sum(df$height^2) - sum(df$height)^2)

#linear regression model

#SSE
SSE <- sum((df$weight - (a * df$height + b))^2)
SSE

#SST
ybar <- mean(df$weight)
SST <- sum((df$weight - ybar)^2)
SST

#SSR
SSR <- SST - SSE
SSR

#Coefficient of determination
R2 <- 1 - (SSE / SST)
R2

df$y_hat <- (a * df$height + b)
df$residual <- df$weight - df$y_hat
head(df)
